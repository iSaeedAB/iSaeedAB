# Why Structuring Matters
Structuring early is vital to protect your investment and your startup. Choosing the right jurisdiction sets you up for success and changing this decision later can be costly and complex. Early structuring also signals to investors that you are serious about your business, and shows you believe in your startup's potential. Poor structuring can limit investors and increase your tax liabilities at exit.

**Why This Matters:** Correct structuring is a foundational element for attracting investment and ensuring long-term financial health.

# Typical Startup Structure
A typical startup structure consists of a holding company and one or more operating companies.

    A[**Holding Company** <br/> <span style="font-size:0.8em;">(Holds IP and assets)</span>] -- **Investment** --> B[**Operating Company**<br/> <span style="font-size:0.8em;">(Transactions with Customers)</span>];
    style A fill:#1a1a1a,stroke:#ffffff,color:#ffffff;
        style B fill:#ffffff,stroke:#1a1a1a,color:#1a1a1a;
    C[**Founders, Investors, Employees (ESOP)**] -- **Equity Ownership** --> A
    style C fill:#1a1a1a,stroke:#ffffff,color:#ffffff;
     
```

The holding company typically sits in a jurisdiction that is tax-efficient and designed to hold assets like IP, while the operating company manages day-to-day operations, revenue, and costs. This separation protects your main entity from issues in any specific operating locations.

**Why This Matters:** This model isolates risk and optimizes for investment and tax efficiency.

# Investable Jurisdictions
Certain jurisdictions are considered more "investable" by VCs and sophisticated investors. These typically have favorable legal systems and no foreign ownership restrictions. Examples include:

-   **UAE:** Abu Dhabi Global Market ([ADGM](https://www.adgm.com/)) and Dubai International Financial Centre ([DIFC](https://www.difc.ae/))
-   **Cayman Islands**
-   **Delaware, USA**
-   **Singapore**

These are commonly accepted and understood jurisdictions where investment agreements can be easily enforced. Approximately 90% of holding companies worldwide are set up in the above-listed regions.

**Why This Matters:** Choosing a recognized jurisdiction eases investor due diligence and reduces friction for future funding rounds.

# Choosing the Right Jurisdiction
The most common jurisdictions are ADGM, Cayman Islands, Delaware and DIFC.

| Jurisdiction   | Setup Cost (USD) | Tax Status      | Key Features                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ADGM          | 3,295            | Tax-Free        | Suitable for startups with GCC national or UAE resident ownership, or those planning to operate in the GCC region.                            |
| Cayman Islands | 2,900            | Tax-Free        | Widely accepted by international VCs, particularly those outside the US. Ideal for global startups not primarily focused on the US market.         |
| Delaware       | 495              | Capital Gains Tax | Suitable for US-based founders and those doing business primarily in the US. Less ideal for global startups due to capital gains tax on exit. |
| DIFC          | Variable          | Tax-Free        |  Commonly used by startups in the Middle East region. Similar to ADGM.  |

Cost alone should not be the main factor. ADGM and Cayman are generally tax-free while Delaware has a 21% capital gains tax on exit. This tax impact should be considered when planning for long-term financial strategy.

**Why This Matters:** Aligning your jurisdiction with your operational and ownership structure is crucial for optimizing financial outcomes.

# Tax Considerations
Taxes on personal income vary by the founder's location. Company profit tax is usually not a significant concern for early-stage startups.

*   **Capital Gains Tax** is applied when a business is sold. For example, Delaware has a 21% capital gains tax. Jurisdictions like the ADGM and the Cayman Islands are tax-free. If you are in a tax-free jurisdiction yourself, and plan on staying regional, it does not make sense to volunteer capital gains tax to Delaware by setting up a holding company there, for example.

**Why This Matters:** Planning for potential tax implications on exit should be considered in your long-term financial strategy.

# When and Where to Start
Founders typically start by creating an operating company in their local jurisdiction. However, the holding company should be set up when:
- Raising money, even from friends and family
- Taking on the first employee
- Registering intellectual property (IP)
- Formalizing a founders' agreement

Setting up a holding company early means key legal documents, such as an ESOP, safe notes, and founder agreements, can be enforced in the right jurisdiction. The holding company is also where you want to have your IP sit, and is most easily defended legally.

**Why This Matters:** Early setup of the holding company ensures legal clarity and allows you to structure operations without potential complications later on.

# Operating Company Considerations
Factors to consider when setting up an operating company include:
-  **Location**: Access to talent, office space, and the overall ecosystem.
-   **Office Space**: The availability and cost of office space can impact your operations.
-   **Ecosystem**: Being in a good ecosystem can provide you with networking and learning opportunities.
-   **Expansion Costs**: This includes Visa costs and the ability to scale your office space as your team grows.
-  **Legal Framework**: Ensure that the operating company is in a jurisdiction where you can raise capital and that legal documents work as expected.

**Why This Matters:** These considerations affect your day-to-day operations, talent acquisition, and long-term growth.

# Legal Documents
Key legal documents for a structured startup include:
-   **Founders' Agreement:** Governs how founders interact, including a reverse vesting clause to address founder disputes.
-   **IP Assignment Agreement:** Ensures all IP is assigned to the company.
-   **Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP):**  Allocates shares to employees as an incentive but doesn't actually take those shares from the cap table.
-   **Safe Notes:** Used for early-stage funding, avoiding the need to sell equity.
-   **Restricted Covenants for Founders:** Prevents founders from competing with the company if they leave.
-   **Founder Service Agreement:** Details the roles and responsibilities of founders.

It's important that these documents align with the location of your holding company for ease of enforcement.

**Why This Matters:** Proper legal documentation protects the company's assets and ensures that all parties have clearly defined roles.

# Banking for Startups
Banking for startups can be challenging due to compliance and the unpredictable nature of startups. Traditional banks often avoid startups, and many neo-banks are still developing.

Options for banking include:
-   **UAE:** Neo-banks like We are or traditional banks like Emirates NBD or Mashreq. (Note that the compliance requirements can change).
-   **US, Cayman, Singapore:** Banks like Mercury, Spire, and Rival are making inroads, particularly following Silicon Valley Bank's collapse.

Setup time varies and may require patience, and can change based on compliance.
Keep in mind, if you are signing an agreement at the holding company level, try to also receive those funds at the holding company bank account level.

**Why This Matters:** Reliable banking is essential for financial operations and compliance.

# Common Structuring Myths

-   **Myth:** Global investors won't invest in ADGM. (False; Large VCs have invested in ADGM)
-   **Myth:** European VCs won't invest in Cayman. (False; Many will still invest, especially if the company is amazing and structured that way)
-   **Myth:** Safe notes work with all operating companies. (False, they must align with the appropriate jurisdictions' laws)
-   **Myth:** Delaware is tax-free. (False, there is 21% capital gains tax)
-   **Myth:** You can move IP from a taxable jurisdiction later. (False; often this is deemed as an exit event)
-   **Myth:** You can clean up your structure at Series A. (False; best to do it early for legal and investor readiness).
-   **Myth:** A bank account is not needed at the holding company level (False, it is needed for good accounting practices and to ensure money is in the right entity).
-   **Myth:** Only US VCs invest in Delaware. (False, many others accept other jurisdictions)

**Why This Matters:** Understanding these myths can prevent costly mistakes in your structuring process.

# Structural Recap
The ideal structure includes:
-   An **operating company** for daily transactions.
-   A **holding company** in a tax-efficient, legally sound jurisdiction for IP and major agreements.
-   **Key legal documents** like founders’ agreements and ESOP in place at the holding company level.
-   The option to change your operating company jurisdiction as the business grows.
