Here’s a Mermaid.js diagram illustrating SOAR Money’s cash flow system using stocks, flows, delays, and feedback loops.

Explanation of the Diagram
	•	Stock & Flow Structure:
	•	SOAR Money’s cash reserves (USDC stock) sit at the center.
	•	Inflows: Users deposit USDC, transaction fees are collected, enterprise clients pay for API services, and partnerships (Visa, on/off-ramps) generate settlement revenue.
	•	Outflows: Users withdraw USDC, merchants request settlements, and SOAR Money pays infrastructure and compliance costs.
	•	Feedback Loops:
	•	More transactions increase fee revenue, which strengthens liquidity.
	•	More merchants onboard reinforces the network effect, driving more business payments.
	•	Growth in deposits creates better liquidity conditions, reducing reliance on external funding.
	•	Delays & Risk Management:
	•	Liquidity Pool: SOAR Money maintains a short-term buffer for handling liquidity mismatches.
	•	DeFi Treasury: A portion of idle reserves is placed in low-risk DeFi yield strategies to earn passive income.
	•	Expense Optimization:
	•	Batch settlements reduce frequent transaction costs.
	•	Deferred compliance payments slow down outflows, improving cash retention.

Key Takeaways from This Model
	1.	Balance liquidity between immediate transaction needs and long-term reserves.
	2.	Create reinforcing loops to grow transaction volume without increasing costs disproportionately.
	3.	Manage timing mismatches between inflows (fees, settlements) and outflows (merchant withdrawals, infra costs).
	4.	Optimize expenses dynamically using batching and DeFi yield on idle funds.
